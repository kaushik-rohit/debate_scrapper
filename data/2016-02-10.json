The report that the right hon. Gentleman quotes from was an opinion poll with an extremely leading question, if he actually looks at what he was looking at. The changes that we are making are reducing social rents by 1% every year for four years. That is good news for people who go out to work, who work hard and who would like to pay less rent. That goes with the lower taxes that they will be paying and the more childcare they will be getting. The other change that we are making, which does not actually come into force until 2018, is to make sure that we are not paying housing benefit to social tenants way above what we would pay to private sector tenants. The simple point is this, and this is where I think Labour has got to focus: every penny you spend on housing subsidy is money you cannot spend on building houses. So let us take this right back to Rosie, in the beginning. She wants a country where we build homes. She wants a country where you can buy a home. She wants a country with a strong economy, so you can afford to buy a home. All those things we are delivering, and you will not deliver them if you go on spending more and more money on subsidised housing and housing benefit. One day Labour has got to realise that welfare bills have to be brought under control."}, {"speaker": "Jeremy Corbyn:", "speech": "      Shelter estimates that the measures in the housing Bill will lose 180,000 affordable homes over the next four years. The Prime Minister is actually overseeing a very damaging housing crisis. It is pricing out people from buying and it is not providing enough social housing. Therefore, many people are forced to rely on the private rented sector. Those on the Benches behind him recently voted against an amendment put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Teresa Pearce) for homes to be fit for human habitation. Labour invested \u00a322 billion in government in bringing social homes up to the decent homes standard. There are now 11 million people in this country who are private renters. Does the Prime Minister know how many of those homes do not meet the decent homes standard?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      In the last five years, we built more council houses than the previous Labour Government built in 13 years. Where was the right hon. Gentleman when that was going on? Thirteen years, and an absolutely hopeless record on housing. What we are doing is this: an \u00a38 billion housing budget that will provide 400,000 new affordable homes, a target to build a million homes during this Parliament, getting housing benefit down so we can spend money on housing, and having a strong economy that can support the housing we need."}, {"speaker": "Jeremy Corbyn:", "speech": "      I was asking the Prime Minister how many of the 11 million renters are living in homes that do not meet the decent homes standard and are, therefore, substandard. I will help him. One third of homes in the private rented sector do not meet the decent homes standard. Shelter has found that six out of 10 renters have to deal with issues such as damp, mould and leaking rooves and windows. It is simply not good enough."}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      Let me just take one of the figures that the right hon. Gentleman mentions. Homelessness today is less than half what it was at its peak under the last Labour Government. There is a simple point here. You can only invest in new houses, you can only restore existing houses, you can only build new houses and you can only support people into those houses if you have got a strong economy. We inherited mass unemployment, an economy that had completely collapsed and a banking crisis. Now we have got zero inflation, wages growing, unemployment at 5%, an economy growing and people able, for the first time, to look to their future and see that they can buy and own a house in our country."}, {"speaker": "Robert Jenrick (Newark) (Con):", "speech": "   Q2.

Surely the 20% reduction in the number of police officers in Greater Manchester will not help to create public confidence."}, {"speaker": "Mike Penning:", "speech": "      That really depends on where those officers were in the first place. Were they working in the communities and on the beat, or were they doing desk jobs? The truth of the matter is that, while we have had a decrease in officers around the country, there are more in front-line duties now than there were in 2010. The other thing the hon. Gentleman might want to ask his local police and crime commissioner, if he is really worried about the funding\u2014even though there would have been a 10% cut under a Labour Government\u2014is why his police force is holding \u00a371 million in reserves."}, {"speaker": "Mr Khalid Mahmood (Birmingham, Perry Barr) (Lab):", "speech": "      May I plead with the Minister to look urgently at the rise in gun crime in the west midlands?

Those who were previously part of the neighbourhood teams are now being put on response duties.

I literally launched it in a canoe\u2014[Interruption.] It was one of my most terrifying moments as a Member of Parliament. Hundreds of young people joined the club, and very good relationships were formed.

I pay tribute to somebody who was a great parliamentarian and who has been a great police and crime commissioner. The work that Vera Baird has done on domestic violence and, more generally, on violence against women and girls is admirable and first class. My hon. Friend is right.

I am totally in favour of innovation and greater collaboration\u2014for example, between the police and fire service\u2014but ultimately there is a simple, grim reality: the remorseless downward pressure on our police service.

Innocent men and women, including British citizens, were being terrified by jihadis practising the most appalling form of terrorism. That officer said, \u201cI had to make a split-second judgment.

We supported the Government in making \u00a31.9 billion more available for MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. We supported them when they said that additional resources would be made available for the British Army for counter-terrorism. Ultimately, however, it came down to this: Chris Sims, the former chief constable in the west midlands, and Bernard Hogan-Howe here in London say that the majority of the leads that result in the detection of terrorists come through good neighbourhood policing. If we have continuing downward pressure on neighbourhood policing and the hollowing out of neighbourhood policing, that will impact, in Mark Rowley\u2019s words, on the eyes and ears of the counter-terrorism effort. It is not enough, therefore, simply to equip the special services and the special forces with additional powers; neighbourhood policing is key on every front, particularly counter-terrorism."}, {"speaker": "Barbara Keeley:", "speech": "      Will my hon.

Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey), that some police forces are peculiarly stretched by a local crime surge? In Salford, we have suffered from 21 shootings over 18 months. The hollowing out of neighbourhood policing, which we have talked about in the debate, is serious when the police have so much more to do because of crime surges such as the one we have seen in Salford. That really ought to be addressed."}, {"speaker": "Keith Vaz:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

One of the great hopes for the cameras is that they will greatly assist in prosecuting domestic violence cases."}, {"speaker": "Rebecca Harris:", "speech": "      Absolutely. I have seen officers in action with their cameras, which they can use, for example, when entering the scene of a domestic dispute to which they have been called. As they arrive, they can record evidence of their own that they can use in court. When the victim of domestic violence is, for whatever reason, nervous, reluctant or intimidated about coming forward, they can prosecute on her behalf. That is an enormous innovation.

It is a great innovation, and the police are very pleased to have it."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Stephenson:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is making a very effective point about her local force.

A lot of things are already going on in the police, but it does cost money just to modernise and make improvements. I wish we did not have such an enormous debt in this country, but ultimately, in a strange way, the drive to create efficiencies means that, when our economy is back on an even keel and the money is again flowing in, our police service will be enormously efficient. Old practices, which have been stuck in place for many years, will have been ironed out."}, {"speaker": "John Stevenson:", "speech": "      On that point, does my hon.

I will come on to that point later, but the innovation of police and crime commissioners was an enormous achievement of the last Parliament.

I always remind myself of the words of the former Prime Minister, the great Marquess of Salisbury, who, when officials and Ministers visited him at Hatfield House to encourage him to do this, say that or think about the other, would press his fingers to his chin and say after a moment\u2019s thought, \u201c\u2019Twere better not.\u201d Governments of all stripes would do well when considering officials\u2019 ideas to say, \u201c\u2019Twere better not.\u201d We might all be better off."}, {"speaker": "Mr Kevan Jones:", "speech": "      I am interested in what the hon.

Labour said that the police could withstand cuts of 10%, but the Chancellor protected police funding, and I welcome that protection, as do many police leaders.

I have resisted drawing them into that, but I look to parish and town councils to exercise economy, recognising that the services that they provide are much valued but that they are paid for by council tax payers.

It is not a question of whether, but how it should be done. A crucial element is the needs assessment review, which will set the basis for the new system of 100% business rates retention for the future. How does the Secretary of State intend to go about that?

That funding is uncertain, risky and back-loaded, and the LGA has asked him if he will inject \u00a3700 million over the next two years because it is so concerned.

Friend is absolutely right, and I will pick up on those points later in my contribution. Returning to the settlement funding assessment, because increases elsewhere do not plug the gap that those cuts create, it will result in cuts to front-line services, including cuts to youth services, fixing potholes, cleaning the streets, emptying the bins, looking after parks, keeping the street lights on at night, Sure Start centres, libraries, museums and rural bus services.

My local authority, North Yorkshire County Council, will receive \u00a315 million in transitional funding over the next two years, and my district authorities will receive \u00a31.4 million. We hear cries of \u201cTory plot\u201d from the Opposition, but my local authority was facing a 37% reduction in its funding, compared with an average of 20% for metropolitan authorities. What kind of Tory plot is that? This is about fairness."}, {"speaker": "John Stevenson (Carlisle) (Con):", "speech": "      Does my hon.

First, I wish to pay tribute to all local councillors, of all political parties and none, for the work that they do in the world of local government, making sure that local services are provided to the people we represent in Parliament. They do an incredible job in difficult circumstances. I say that having been a councillor on Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council for 12 years. My wife has been a Tameside councillor for 16 years, and I know the very difficult decisions she and her colleagues are having to make at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Barbara Keeley:", "speech": "      Today, I have been downstairs to meet people from the Malnutrition Task Force, which is doing some brilliant work in Salford. We have more than 2,000 cases of malnutrition\u2014we are talking about people over 65 here. This sort of thing is developing now. Cynical comments are made by Conservative Members about the real concern Labour Members have. We did not used to need a malnutrition taskforce, and 193 out of 2,000 cases of malnourished older people were found in Salford. I know that Tameside has now launched a food bank to deal with this issue."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Gwynne:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right about that.

Friend is right that it is a synthetic froth. Let us take Tameside and Trafford. In the original settlement, Trafford was facing a 28% reduction in Government-funded spending power, against 19% in Tameside. Surrey was facing a 54% cut\u2014I would never normally speak up for Surrey\u2014so it is no wonder that it got some transitional relief."}, {"speaker": "Simon Hoare:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is right. Frankly, the Opposition party has been rumbled on this. Let us not kid ourselves, this remains, even after the welcome announcement made by the Minister on Monday, a tough settlement. It leaves an unfair and unsustainable gap between funding for rural and urban areas. That continues. It has just been made a little less tough. There is no golden goose being given to Tory local government."}, {"speaker": "Liam Byrne:", "speech": "      I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take back the point about synthetic rage. If other hon. Members had a hospital such as the one in my constituency, which is \u00a354 million in deficit, and where delayed discharges are up 1,000% in a year because of public funding cuts, they would have a responsibility to stand up and say, \u201cThink carefully about how you distribute money.\u201d If they are representing a city such as Birmingham where there is another \u00a392 million to come out of social care on top of the crisis that is already there, then, collectively as a country, we have a problem. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take back his comment and recognise that there are genuine questions about the distribution mechanisms being put forward by the Secretary of State."}, {"speaker": "Simon Hoare:", "speech": "      If Birmingham City Council is funding its local hospital, it might explain some of its problems.

My constituency may be rich in talent, but it is one of the poorest in the country.
