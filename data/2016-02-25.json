It is important that we ensure that witnesses who are engaged in criminal trials, which will be difficult experiences for them at the best of times, understand what is happening in the case around them.

Better training for prosecutors in dealing with cases, particularly where vulnerable witnesses or children are involved, is important and we are doing that too.

We now know the answer today\u2014it is a DCLG responsibility, and I am glad that that Department has actually taken it on."}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the hon. Gentleman. The Department has been working on this application for some time. We had to draw together a range of information across Government Departments, talk to local areas, and assess the cost and impact of events that have taken place. That is what we have been doing, and what we will continue to do. As more information comes through and we go through the process of supporting those communities, we will ensure that the application is thorough, and that it accounts for all opportunities to add to it and to recognise the damage that has been done. Those discussions have been taking place across Government in the right way and in the right timeframe, so that we were able to make our announcement."}, {"speaker": "Mr Ian Liddell-Grainger (Bridgwater and West Somerset) (Con):", "speech": "      I gently say to the Minister and the House, that, in 2011, Somerset suffered from disastrous floods. The Prime Minister and my local area looked at this fund   "}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend has demonstrated an understanding of the European Union solidarity fund that is absent among those on the Opposition Front Bench. It is a complex fund which requires a number of facts to be taken into consideration. There is an administration process that will take a long time and cost a significant amount. That is why we had to carry out a proper assessment to understand whether it would be of net benefit to the UK taxpayer to make an application before we got to the place where we could make the announcement that I have been able to confirm today. That is the right process, and my hon. Friend has demonstrated from his own constituency experience his deep understanding of the issue and the complexities of the matters before the House."}, {"speaker": "Calum Kerr (Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk) (SNP):", "speech": "      I welcome the statement. The Minister talks about the rapid response. Where was the rapid decision-making process on the Government\u2019s part? I welcome the announcement, but it was not a difficult question. If we have an insurance policy, of course we are going to cash it in. Why would we not do so? That is logical and sensible. I welcome it. In relation to Scotland, have the Minister and his Department calculated how much money will be coming to Scotland, owing to Barnett consequentials? Can he say anything about the timescale and when that might be expected?"}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      The rapid response that I was talking about was the money that the Government immediately made available, the hard work that was done, particularly by my colleagues and officials in DEFRA, the Environment Agency and emergency responders\u2014the work that was done straight away to support the communities affected by flooding. I can confirm that one of the factors that has delayed the process and made it more difficult to carry out the very complicated assessment that underpins the application to the EU solidarity fund has been the slowness of getting the information that we needed out of the Scottish Government. Had they responded more quickly, perhaps we would have been better informed earlier and able to announce with more clarity what would be done."}, {"speaker": "Mr Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):", "speech": "      Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Three weeks ago I asked the Prime Minister why we were not applying for these funds. I am delighted that we are now doing so. More than 300 of my households were hit by the floods. A third of them were not covered by insurance because of the high premiums and eye-watering excesses. Perhaps some of this extra money can help them. In one case a business, the Ribchester Arms, has been closed since Boxing day. It has lost tens of thousands of pound and still has ongoing costs.   "}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      There are thresholds that have to  be met, there is an assessment of damage that has to be done, and there is no guarantee that an application to the fund would yield more money than the cost of applying and delivering it. None the less, we have made that assessment and have come to this decision. I am delighted that it pleases my hon. Friend. I would be happy to have discussions with him about individual businesses in his constituency, but I remind him that regardless of what happens with this fund, the Government have made significant funding available to support local businesses and communities affected by flooding. That funding is available now. We do not have to wait for this fund to come through to support the communities affected."}, {"speaker": "Mr Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):", "speech": "      My constituency was not damaged in the most recent floods, but in the past when flooding has taken place, speed is of the essence. I have known people in my constituency to wait not just months, but years, to get back in their home to a decent standard of life. It is all very well for the Minister to be uncharitable and find himself unable to say anything nice about the European Union, which provides the fund. People do not want just the wellies on the day; they want the action after the flooding."}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman is right\u2014speed is of the essence, which is why the Government have made more than \u00a3200 million available to areas affected and made it available as quickly as possible\u2014immediately \u2014for the communities that needed support, so that support is there. This fund will take time to pay out. That is the way the process that has been put in place works. It will take months from the date of application to come to conclusion. We have decided to apply because we have assessed it to be of net benefit to the UK to do so, but the funding that communities needed was provided by this Government straight away."}, {"speaker": "Mr Christopher Chope (Christchurch) (Con):", "speech": "      My hon. Friend says that this is an important application, but will he put it in context? Every day British taxpayers pay \u00a350 million to the European Union.

The Government have done the assessment, so what do they   "}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      I have to make it clear that there was no guarantee that the fund would bring a net benefit to the UK, or that it would be possible to apply, until a proper assessment had been done of the level of damage, the regional thresholds and whether we qualified to make an application. That assessment has now been done and we have announced our intention to apply before the deadline, which is the right thing to do. We will then work through the process to ensure that the UK gets the maximum benefit that can be delivered. Separately from that, the Government are already doing what needs to be done to support communities. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart), has been doing a huge amount of work in Cumbria, as I am sure the right hon. Gentleman knows, to ensure that communities get the support they need, regardless of the progress made with this fund. It will take time, but we are now committed to applying to the fund."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) (Con):", "speech": "      Can the Minister confirm that the UK paid \u00a336.5 million into the EU solidarity fund last year, making us the second largest net contributor, and that we have only ever claimed once, in 2007, when we received \u00a3130 million? Is not the reason we have been reluctant to claim that we get very little out of the scheme because of our rebate? Effectively, we are paying into an insurance scheme that we cannot claim from."}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right that there is an interplay between the application for funds, the funds being paid out and the rebate. The reality is that this is a complex process and there are restrictions on how money that is released can be spent. We have made the assessment and believe that the fund will be of net benefit to the UK, which is why we have today announced our intention to apply."}, {"speaker": "Stuart Blair Donaldson (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (SNP):", "speech": "      Today\u2019s announcement is welcome, but it is long overdue.

Gentleman ask an important question. Much of this, as a devolved matter, is dealt with by the Scottish Government, but we have had ongoing discussions with them, including, in the context of the application I have announced today, on the information we need from them to underpin the parts of the application that apply to Scotland."}, {"speaker": "Craig Whittaker (Calder Valley) (Con):", "speech": "      This is excellent news. I accept that there are complexities in the EU solidarity fund, but what is unpalatable, and a horrendous burden for the people Calder Valley, is the \u00a332 million    "}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend has been one of the most diligent and passionate advocates for his area; since the storms in December and January, scarcely a day has gone by when we have not discussed matters pertaining to Calder Valley.

Following the assessment he has done, can he indicate exactly what value of funding will be available?"}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      I thank the hon. Lady for her question, and I wish to put on the record on the Floor of the House my appreciation for the constructive nature of the debate we had in Westminster Hall\u2014I think it brings out the best in this place when we pull together to do what we can to support the communities we all represent. As I am sure she will appreciate, we are at the stage of having identified that applying will be of net benefit to the UK. We still have a lot of work to do to finalise the costs and figures that we will submit to the Commission, so I am not in a position to confirm what the entire net benefit will be at the end of the process, but we will of course keep the House updated as progress is made."}, {"speaker": "Chris Heaton-Harris (Daventry) (Con):", "speech": "      To not give false hope to the communities everyone is talking about today, the Minister must say at the Dispatch Box that there is no guarantee of our ever receiving this money. Domestically, the process is complicated enough, but when we get to the European process, whereby we apply for some of our own money to come back to this country, it becomes even more complicated, and the timeline is extremely long. Will he give us a rough idea of how long the timeline was in 2007? Will he also assure communities that the Government are spending money now that is helping them, and that we will do well in the future even if this money from Europe does not come?"}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As I have said, this is not a rapid response fund; the money takes a long time to come through. The Government therefore made more than \u00a3200 million available straightaway to provide the support that communities need. My hon.

My constituents, particularly in the West Kirby area, which is vulnerable to flooding, will be pleased to hear this news, but they will be a little baffled about why things have taken so long. I appreciate that work has been going on in the background, as the Minister said, but given what a miserable experience people have gone through, it would have been helpful if the Government had communicated their intention earlier. Will the Minister give an assurance that, should these things happen again, the Government will be prepared to apply to the fund?"}, {"speaker": "James Wharton:", "speech": "      I cannot give an assurance that the Government will always apply to the fund, because we may not always meet the threshold criteria to apply. We will always have to assess the cost-benefit to ensure that the cost of managing and delivering the fund does not outweigh the benefit that could come from it, and that includes, of course, the impact on the rebate.

Lady\u2019s local businesses are baffled, but I am sure that, on leaving the House today, she will wait not a moment to explain to them the reality of the process.

There is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that we fully understand and apply for every bit of applicable damage, and we have announced that we will undertake that process.

There is still work to be done on the recovery.

Indeed, the pensions of this country are often found in the City of London, and they affect every single person up and down the land. Does the right hon.

It is perfectly legitimate to point out those risks, which even the hon.

In truth, almost half our exports go to Europe precisely because we are part of the single market, and we must think about supply chains and services.

Indeed, when one of the Ministers who advocates Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union was asked on television at the weekend to provide an example of red tape, he referred to health and safety. Health and safety is not red tape, a burden or regulation; it is about protecting British, German and Spanish workers when they go to work in the morning, to make sure that they can do their jobs safely and securely.

The European arrest warrant is a really good example of that.

I am convinced that, from the \u201cin\u201d point of view, the argument must be presented at that level.

These are the arguments we are going to focus on."}, {"speaker": "Mr Jenkin:", "speech": "      Even if Scotland were to vote to leave the EU, the case the right hon.

Does he agree that whatever the outcome of the referendum, the Government remain answerable to Parliament and they should not proceed to any precipitate or even self-harming action, which a precipitate move to article 50 might be, unless they have consulted Parliament and gained its consent for the next steps? In my view, that might require some discussion with all our European partners and consultation with other parts of the United Kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Alex Salmond:", "speech": "      I was pointing out that if the Government\u2019s position that such a process would not be necessary because there had been a referendum vote, where does that leave the Scottish Parliament, if, under the conventions I have cited from the Library document, it was to have a parliamentary vote, having had a positive popular vote\u2014a yes, an \u201cin\u201d vote\u2014for Europe, using exactly the same argument as the Foreign Secretary now deploys to announce the democratic short-circuiting of parliamentary convention?

That really does happen, so how can he marry the two?"}, {"speaker": "Alex Salmond:", "speech": "      I can do it in a number of ways, one of which I shall now describe. Independent countries in Europe that are outside the euro area control 99% of their taxation base\u2014everything except the VAT contribution. The figure for Scotland within the United Kingdom will be 25%, even after\u2014if it is implemented\u2014this week\u2019s settlement. I regard 25% control of the tax base as not being independence in any meaningful sense, whereas I regard 99% control as meaningful independence and therefore worth the sacrifice in sovereignty that is inevitably made to achieve objectives such as peace, environmental protection and having solidarity when we face a continental crisis.

Friend, and I am sure he would agree with me on this. As he knows, I have utter admiration for his grandfather, being one who was born on 10 May 1940, when he assumed the prime ministership of this country and when Hitler invaded Holland and France. However, many of Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s pronouncements on the issue of Europe changed as time progressed. In particular, he said at one point, much later than 1948, that we should be \u201cassociated but not absorbed\u201d. The movements that were taking place and which were apparent to Sir Anthony Eden and to others in the late 1940s and early 1950s did have a significant impact on the thinking of our great, great former Prime Minister Sir Winston himself. In saying that we should be associated but not absorbed, he had understood that there were movements afoot that were not in the interests of the United Kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Mr Jackson:", "speech": "      Like many Conservative Members of Parliament, we wished the Prime Minister well as he went forward with negotiations.

The Prime Minister also said that our democracy in our Westminster Parliament was the root of our freedom of choice\u2014that was the essence of what he was saying. I also have fears about the framework of this agreement and the developments by successive Governments in successive treaties. For example, I voted yes in 1975. While I pursued the Government and harried them over the Maastricht rebellion, the situation changed dramatically when the Maastricht treaty was brought into being."}, {"speaker": "Alex Salmond:", "speech": "      I know that some of the hon.

As I have said, these were decisions that were taken in 1972 on the basis of a White Paper, which said that we would always retain  a veto. That is the difference. In fact, it has been whittled away by successive Governments and I have opposed them from the moment that I saw the Maastricht treaty to the present day, as the right hon.

Ireland regularly has referendums on treaties, and they sometimes have a second one, but normally after another discussion with the European Union in which they change parts of the treaty to make it more favourable to Ireland. Had we voted no to the Lisbon treaty, I suspect that there might have been a different project for the United Kingdom in\u2014a third way, to use Tony Blair\u2019s favourite phrase\u2014in a more associative relationship with the European Union, based more on trade than on the political entity that we know a number of European Union leaders want.

It is not necessarily the case that coming out of the European Union will make us safer from attacks. I think there is a danger from some\u2014not Members and certainly not my hon.

How could I, when I come from a post-war generation where my parents constantly talked about the war? It was the essential fact of their life. My parents were 25 in 1945. My mother had to flee Paris hours before the German tanks rolled in. Her best friend, who was Jewish, had to throw herself off a train and was killed as she was being taken to the death camps. My father also had to flee France.

Does he think that the European Union attempting, in a rather cack-handed way, to create an association agreement with Ukraine was a good move to make? Has it made Europe a safer place? Has it not led directly\u2014I do not approve of this\u2014to the annexation of Crimea?

It is for the Government of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom being the member state party to the treaties, to decide whether to trigger an article 50 process after such a referendum result. But he is right to say that there would be some pretty complicated outworkings of British departure from the EU for all three devolved Administrations and for the United Kingdom and English statute book, because a fair number of Acts of Parliament reflect European law as it has developed over the past 40 years.

Such is the strength of feeling about the matter among people who live in the High Peak, particularly in Glossop, that there is now a petition on the parliamentary website created by my constituent, David Saggerson.

The challenge that we face with rail is that we have an enormous backlog of investment. The rail industry is a huge success, but that huge success brings with it the need for more capacity. There are as many people using our rail network now as there were in the late 1920s, but the network is only a fraction of the size. Governments of all colours have underinvested over many years, and we need to catch up. That is what the control period peak budget of \u00a338 billion is about. I will take forward my hon. Friend\u2019s point about where that work can be carried out on the Hope Valley line, and I will liaise with Network Rail on that. Rail is a key ingredient in improving connectivity in many areas. Although we are investing very heavily, we also require investment where the Hope Valley line enters the big conurbations in Manchester and Sheffield. We must also bear in mind the impact that High Speed 2 will have on such key connections."}]
