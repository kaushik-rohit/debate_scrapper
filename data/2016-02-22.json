The second point I would make\u2014I made this point earlier\u2014is that, yes, we have a trade deficit in goods, but we have a massive trade surplus in services and it is in the single market in services where the prospects for progress are greatest today. So there would be a danger if we were to leave that maybe we would get that deal on goods relatively quickly because of our deficit, but if they held up the deal on services where would all our service companies be?

However, when we consider defence and security in the round today, and how we fight terrorism, yes, it depends on those other relationships, but it also depends on what we do through the EU. I see that every day through the exchange of information. For example, let us take the agreement we also reached at this Council to ensure a strong NATO mission to try to help the situation between Greece and Turkey. It is a NATO mission, which backs up my hon. Friend\u2019s point, but where was some of the conversation about it going on? Where were the Germans, the British and the French sitting together to work out what assets we could supply and how we could get real power into it? It was done around the European Council table.

We are treaty-bound by NATO, under article 5, to go to the defence of a fellow member that is under armed attack\u2014that obliges us. In that sense, we have lost sovereignty because we believe it is in the interests of the country to enter that agreement and that it has made us safer.

We have our own currency and our own banking supervision arrangements. In trying to supervise a complex, large economy such as Britain, which has one of the largest financial centres anywhere in the world, not just banks but other financial institutions such as central counterparties are systemically important.

Last week, after much delay, the long- awaited report by the mental health taskforce, which was commissioned by NHS England, was published.

I have received no indication that a Minister intends to make a statement on the matter. What I would say provisionally, having learned of this matter only a small number of moments ago, is that significant announcements of changes of policy should be made first to the House. That means, save in cases of emergency, that they should be made to the House while it is sitting. Of course, right hon. and hon.

First, I say very gently\u2014I am trying to be kind to him because he is a new Member, albeit an extremely distinguished fellow\u2014that if he wants to raise points of order and argue the toss about the proprieties of parliamentary procedure, perhaps he might learn that he should refer to the Leader of the Opposition as the Leader of the Opposition, not call him by name.

When they have taken the new pledge, however, what sanctions will there be if they fail to honour it and who will decide?"}, {"speaker": "Mrs Villiers:", "speech": "      Naturally enough, any sanctions relating to the actions of MLAs are matters for the Assembly, rather than for the Chamber and the legislation proposed here today.

It remains the case that the Bill does not provide for sanctions and nor does the fresh start agreement.

In those circumstances, we should do everything possible to make sure that it has an ordinary timetable. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will not give an absolute undertaking on that for today\u2019s purposes, but if we get to the stage of being able to present that Bill to Parliament, it is highly likely that we will want to proceed with it on the basis of an ordinary timetable rather than an expedited one, given the sensitivity of the issues."}, {"speaker": "Mr Gregory Campbell (East Londonderry) (DUP):", "speech": "      Does the Secretary of State agree that one element of the legacy issue that is paramount in the minds of many survivors of the troubles is that under no account and under no circumstances must Northern Ireland be seen to go forward on the basis of treating the perpetrators of violence in the same way as those who were innocent victims of that very violence?"}, {"speaker": "Mrs Villiers:", "speech": "      I entirely agree. We on the Government side would never accept a rewriting of history.

The PSNI operates within stringent budget constraints. It has to prioritise front-line policing, but it is being asked to do more and more. While the current impasse exists, should it not receive funds from this place rather than having to use some of its own resources to deal with the legacy of the past?"}, {"speaker": "Vernon Coaker:", "speech": "      I very much agree with my hon. Friend, and with the First Minister and others in Northern Ireland who have pointed out that, although agreement has not been reached on how to deal with the legacy issues, the PSNI, the Coroners Service for Northern Ireland and others are still required to deal with the consequences of those issues. Given that the Secretary of State has put aside money pending any agreement, surely it would be acceptable to give at least some of it to those bodies in order to reflect the continuing work that they must do in trying to investigate and resolve some of the difficulties. I think that that the First Minister has made a perfectly reasonable request, and, although I know that the Secretary of State will not be able to respond to it now, I hope that she and the Minister\u2014and, indeed, the Government as a whole\u2014will consider it."}, {"speaker": "Mrs Villiers:", "speech": "      May I intervene briefly to offer some assistance? The fresh start agreement makes it clear that the \u00a3150 million package to support the legacy work is linked to the establishment of the new bodies.

If a credible reform package for inquests is put together, we will of course take very seriously any request for funds to support it."}, {"speaker": "Vernon Coaker:", "speech": "      That is a helpful response. I think that everyone in the House\u2014and, indeed, in Northern Ireland\u2014will have heard what the Secretary of State has said, which implies that she is open to making money available both to the PSNI and to the Coroners Service. I think that that is what victims would expect. They know that it is difficult to reach an agreement on how to deal with the past\u2014and, although the institutions, or the proposed institutions, are there, agreement has not been reached\u2014but, at the same time, work has to be done.

His death is a stunning shock, and my heart goes out to his parents, Brian and Maureen. I do hope it is in order for me to pay the greatest tribute to him possible today. All hon.

Thank you very much indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker."}, {"speaker": "Ian Paisley:", "speech": "      I appreciate the point the hon. Gentleman is making. Sometimes we do have to stop and pinch ourselves and recognise how far Northern Ireland has come in recent years. The point he is making about Northern Ireland politicians taking decisions about the needs of the people of Northern Ireland is emphasised today, as there have been something like 26 amendments on the Floor of the Northern Ireland Parliament today, being voted and consulted on and considered by Northern Ireland\u2019s elected representatives. That shows that instead of decisions being taken in Committee Rooms here, they are being taken in Northern Ireland by the elected representatives on the Floor of the Assembly, and they are very prosperous and good decisions."}, {"speaker": "Mr Robertson:", "speech": "      I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, which emphasises far more strongly than I was able to the importance of the Assembly\u2019s functioning. When we sat in Committee taking big decisions, the great problem was that by the nature of the arithmetic of this House, there were very few people on the Committee from Northern Ireland. The decisions were taken by people like me and many others from English constituencies, with very few representatives from Northern Ireland, so the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to make that point."}, {"speaker": "Mr Gregory Campbell:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman refers to issues on which consensus and agreement were reached. Does he agree that the issue of corporation tax was one on which consensus was reached eventually, and that people were and are looking forward to the prospect of possibly tens of thousands of jobs being created in Northern Ireland? How does he feel about the fact that the delay in reaching that consensus was principally down to Northern Ireland\u2019s and the UK\u2019s membership of the EU?

The First Minister of Northern Ireland made a speech on Friday night, outlining again the importance of transparency and of that matter being dealt with and taken forward in precisely that way. Whether the Bill is the right vehicle for that remains to be seen, because it would require agreement and consultation within Northern Ireland. That could\u2014and indeed should\u2014happen, and I encourage parties to do that. It is important to maintain confidence in the integrity of the Assembly.

It is such a crass story, but they run it week in, week out, telling people to look at the disinterest in this place when Northern Ireland is being discussed compared with when a European issue or a financial issue is being discussed.

We have worked hard with people who were previously involved in paramilitary activity to enable them to complete the transition to what is now purely community development work, and those communities have been transformed as a result. For example, the Old Warren in Lisburn in my constituency has been transformed as a result of the transition of people previously involved in loyalist paramilitarism to purely community development. I commend the Resurgam Trust in Lisburn and its leadership on what they have done to transform that community by enabling those people to make that transition. I assure the hon.

Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound), who in every debate is optimistic and positive, and it is especially welcome that in what is, effectively, another stage of the Stormont House agreement and the fresh start agreement, we find ourselves in this Second Reading with the full support of Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker) and all those on the Opposition Front Bench for their continued support for making sure that we move Northern Ireland onwards to normalisation and ensure any bumps in the road that we have experienced are sorted out to allow the Northern Ireland political settlement to bed in and move forward so that the people there can take hold of the opportunities on offer."}, {"speaker": "Mark Durkan:", "speech": "      Does the Minister agree that when investigating the past, the police ombudsman has always respected such matters fully? It has never breached or compromised anybody\u2019s interest in that regard, so surely others could be trusted to adhere to the same standard?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Wallace:", "speech": "      Everyone is entrusted with the powers that they are granted. National security does not just cover the actions of the PSNI; it covers the actions of the security services and of a range of people involved in trying to ensure that our society is safe and secure. We should remember that national security is not taken lightly. It is open to scrutiny by our Intelligence and Security Committee in this House, by the ombudsman and by the courts. The coroner and the judges often make the final decisions on many of these issues and   "}, {"speaker": "Mark Durkan:", "speech": "      On that basis, given that these organisations need to be rightly blamed and indicted for what they did, does the Minister now regret that the British Government for so long maintained the UDA\u2019s status as a legal organisation and consistently refused to proscribe it?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Wallace:", "speech": "      If memory serves me right, the UDA was proscribed in 1992. I was not in this House and I was not privy to the Government. In fact, in 1992 I was walking around west Belfast. As for the idea that I can condemn or support the ruling, all I know is that when I   "}, {"speaker": "Vernon Coaker:", "speech": "      May I just press the Minister once more on this issue? He mentions dealing with the legacy of the past. I asked the Secretary of State, but I want to be clear about this because a number of questions have arisen throughout this interesting and good debate. Will the Minister and the Secretary of State look again at releasing some of the funding that the Treasury and the Government have put aside for dealing with legacy issues to fund the PSNI and the coroner service to deal with some of these issues which were supposed to be dealt with by other institutions? Because of the inability to come to an agreement, the PSNI and the coroner service have been left to deal with them but not been given the resources to tackle them. Will the Minister re-examine that?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Wallace:", "speech": "      Absolutely, we will support any measures that deal with the legacy, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said. We cannot just release the money; we need all the actors on the stage to produce the solution. We need the victims, the PSNI, the courts, the Lord Chief Justice and the Executive to support the solution. If we were just to release money but nobody else was supporting the schemes or the coroners\u2019 courts changes, for example, we would not necessarily solve the issue. We will look with all seriousness and all support at any proposals to solve the legacy issues."}, {"speaker": "Ms Ritchie:", "speech": "      I referred to the split of moneys between the National Crime Agency and the PSNI. Would it be possible for the Minister to follow that up in writing to me?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Wallace:", "speech": "      I thank the hon. Lady for reminding me of something: \u00a328 million has been allocated for tackling paramilitary activity. As far as I understand it, how that is divided is an operational decision about who needs it and where it should go. That sum has been allocated, and we think it is a step in the right direction in tackling paramilitary activity. If there is any more to tell her, I will certainly write to her."}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford (Ross, Skye and Lochaber) (SNP):", "speech": "      We have heard much today in the debate on our future in or out of the European Union about the issue of our security.

Friend for securing this important debate. As one of the five Scottish National party Members for the highlands and islands, he will of course be aware that we have repeatedly called on the Government to address the maritime safety deficit caused by the removal of the Stornoway vessel in 2010-11.

If Members keep their interventions brief, more Members can come in."}, {"speaker": "Brendan O'Hara:", "speech": "      My last point is that the coast has been left vulnerable. Does my hon. Friend believe that the removal of the ETV at Kirkwall would be utterly unthinkable?"}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford:", "speech": "      I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, and he is quite correct. We cannot comprehend the possible risk of the loss of the vessel in Kirkwall. It is also true that there is no way in reasonable time that that vessel based in Kirkwall can get to Argyll and Bute or indeed to large parts of my constituency. We have been placed at an unacceptable level of risk. Does the Minister agree with the chief executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that the removal of the Kirkwall-based vessel is unacceptable, and will he give the House an assurance that the Government will find the necessary funds to make sure that that vessel remains in place? That is a simple question, and it requires a simple yes or no answer."}, {"speaker": "Dr Paul Monaghan (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (SNP):", "speech": "      Does my hon. Friend agree that on safety and on all the issues that you have highlighted, the UK Government need to take into account the fact that in the coming years there will be more than 200 movements of nuclear material from Dounreay, and some of that material will be transported by sea?"}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Natascha Engel):", "speech": "      Order.

I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Dr Monaghan).

In the previous Parliament, before SNP Members were so numerous, there would be very few Members at a debate such as this. The UK Government are playing fast and loose because of an event that might happen once in 25 years, once in 50 years or once in 100 years. They have no insurance policy because they are a penny-wise, pound-foolish Government who are playing fast and loose with the Scottish coastline, which my hon. Friend and I represent and care about. If the UK Government respected Scotland and genuinely thought of the UK as a family of nations, they would step up to the mark now, instead of abdicating their responsibilities."}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford:", "speech": "      I thank my hon. Friend for that fine intervention. I look forward to hearing the Minister answering it, as we have not had an answer yet. Five of us went to see the Minister last November. We have been waiting quite some time for this Government to take their responsibilities seriously."}, {"speaker": "Mr MacNeil:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend asks a pertinent question. He says we do not know what boats are going up the west coast of Scotland at the moment. Actually, looking at a marine traffic app, we can see that an 11,000-tonne oil and chemical tanker is going up there just now\u2014it is between South Uist and my hon. Friend\u2019s home in Skye. There is no insurance policy for that boat travelling through the Minches, because of the UK Government\u2019s negligence. He makes a salient point when he says that we do not know what is going up the west coast; in fact, we do, but the point is that the UK Government do not, because they are not looking at these apps, and they are not worried, because this is Scotland."}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford:", "speech": "      It is too far from Westminster. Why should they care? However, my hon. Friend makes an important point. The vessel that ran aground at Ardnamurchan\u2014the Lysblink Seaways\u2014was a general cargo vessel. Can we just stop and think for a minute about what would have happened if an oil vessel had run aground at Ardnamurchan? We should just think about the environmental damage that could have happened. We should think about the threat to the tourist industry in Ardnamurchan\u2014this is a fragile economy that depends on tourism. We cannot accept that risk. The Government have to act to protect communities up and down the west and north coast of Scotland."}, {"speaker": "Mr Alistair Carmichael (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):", "speech": "      Will the hon.

Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford) on securing this important debate and, indeed, on having the foresight to do so on a night when the main business in the Chamber collapsed early, which will allow a few other Members to contribute. I hope other hon. Members will have something to say, because the hon. Gentleman has explained at some length the importance of this issue to our island and coastal communities."}, {"speaker": "The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Mr Robert Goodwill):", "speech": "      I congratulate the hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford) on securing this debate on the subject of ETVs. Only the Department for Transport could come up with a three-letter acronym for a three-letter word\u2014tug. Let me be clear from the start that I share the hon. Gentleman\u2019s passion for protecting the Scottish coast. The hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil) said that I did not care about Scotland. I assure him that Scotland is every bit as much part of my country as is Yorkshire or any other part. I do care for the environment around Scotland and for the welfare of seamen on that part of our seas."}, {"speaker": "Mr MacNeil:", "speech": "      I am grateful to the Minister for mentioning me and for giving way, as is the convention in the House. Will we see his concern and his fine words manifested not only in the retention of the ETV in the Northern Isles, but in the return of the ETV to Stornoway, in the Hebrides?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      Let me develop my argument, and I will return to that point. Scotland is not only a stunning landscape but the home of important industries such as agriculture and fishing, which are economically important to Scotland and the whole United Kingdom. Protecting the environment and safety at sea are our top priorities. The hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber mentioned the Cromarty firth oil transfer licence. Marine Scotland was directly consulted on 10 December, and on 8 February, when the consultation ended, it had not responded. When it was asked whether it intended to respond, the answer was no. I hope that that clarifies that point."}, {"speaker": "Mr MacNeil:", "speech": "      The Minister\u2019s arguments are all well and good if there are tug boats available to do that work, but what if there are no tug boats available? Where coastal communities and our coastline are at risk, a responsible Government would make sure that that capacity was there where the market and the private sector were failing. The market and the private sector are failing in that on the north and west coast of Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford) has secured the debate because of that failure and the lack of those boats."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      If the hon. Gentleman will relax a little, I will come on to some of those points. He might find that he need not be quite as irate as he is, because I share his concerns."}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford:", "speech": "      I agree with the Minister\u2019s points about the improvements that have taken place, but they would still not prevent things such as the Lysblink Seaways, which ran aground on Ardnamurchan, or indeed the Costa Concordia. That is the point. Even with the improvements that have been made, there is still a risk to our communities from something like that happening \u2014an unexpected happening, such as an oil tanker running aground. This is about how we provide such protection, even with the improvements that have taken place in the shipping industry."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman\u2019s point is absolutely valid. I am talking about some of the other vessels that we have been able to remove from around the coast because of other factors."}, {"speaker": "Mr MacNeil:", "speech": "      In fairness to the Minister he is genuinely allowing us to have an exchange of views. However, I find his argument akin to saying, \u201cMy house was built in 1906 and it has not been on fire since, and therefore I do not need fire insurance for my house.\u201d The reality is\u2014this is the point made by the hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber in this debate\u2014that we should have an insurance policy. The Minister is telling me that, no matter the age of my house, I do not need insurance for my house\u2014or, in this case, coastal insurance. In that, the UK Government have been found short and very wanting."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman is quite correct to raise the issue of risk. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland talked about the MCA looking at all potential risks. Indeed, the risk assessment by the MCA    "}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford:", "speech": "      I am listening very carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who is being very considerate with his time. He is identifying that there is a risk from the removal of the ETV. We already know that a grounding has taken place at Ardnamurchan. We already know that the MCA has referred to the time it took to travel to that vessel. The Orkney vessel cannot provide that degree of protection in a timely manner on the west coast. To give security to our community, we need to retain the insurance cover that many of us have mentioned. We need the vessel in Orkney, but we desperately need the vessel on the west coast. What will the Minister say if we end up with an incident at some point in the future\u2014heaven forbid\u2014if we could have had such an ETV to give us at least a degree of protection. That is the price we are asking the Government to pay tonight."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      I have made the point that the one vessel we have is best stationed where it is because of the risk and the type of traffic to which it can respond."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      The second question is what alternative arrangements are available to maintain an appropriate towage capability that could reduce the burden on the UK taxpayer."}, {"speaker": "Roger Mullin (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) (SNP):", "speech": "      I did not intend to speak in this debate, but I have heard the Government talk about risk on so many occasions   "}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Natascha Engel):", "speech": "      Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman said that he was not going to make a speech, but if he could keep his interventions a bit shorter, we would all be very grateful."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are acutely aware of the risk and the damage that could be caused to the environment or, indeed, the loss of life that could occur if that risk is not correctly assessed and the response correctly put in place."}, {"speaker": "Mr Alistair Carmichael:", "speech": "      The Minister is to be congratulated on this announcement. It is clearly not the end of the story, but it is a significant act of good faith. I thank him for taking this step this evening. Will he take away from the House the message that came from the stakeholder engagement meeting on 10 February, which was that this work has to be done again and it has to be done properly? The standard and content of the risk assessment is not good enough. He has given us time. Will that time be used to do the work properly?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      I have already made the point that the level of risk has not changed substantially since previous assessments, but we do need to explore other ways in which that risk could be addressed. The point   "}, {"speaker": "Ian Blackford:", "speech": "      We welcome the announcement the Government have made this evening. That is the right thing to do. What I would say to the Minister, however, is that we explained what happened in Ardnamurchan. The ETV cannot get from Orkney in a reasonable amount of time. In light of the decision the Minister has made this evening and in light of the risk assessment that must take place, will he revisit the need and desire for a second vessel based in Stornoway to cover the west coast, based on a realistic understanding of risk as outlined by me, my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Roger Mullin) and others? We cannot accept that our communities should be left at risk. This is a small price to pay. We need that insurance policy. I am grateful that the Orkney vessel is being kept on for the next six months, but please let us make sure we get a solution that protects all our communities. That means the re-establishment of a two-vessel solution for the north and the west of Scotland."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      I certainly hear what the hon. Gentleman says. The provision of the ETV and the steaming times to get to certain locations where it may be needed is something we need to address. I urge all those with an interest to seize the opportunity this extra time brings to work with the MCA to implement a longer term strategy to meet this need. I hope right hon. and hon. Members will give their encouragement for that."}, {"speaker": "Mr MacNeil:", "speech": "      I am very grateful for the Government U-turn, although it is only for six months. We have concentrated a lot on pollution, but two months\u2019 ago the cruise ship Star Pride ran aground at 6.15 am on 22 December near Isla de Coiba, Panama. In such a situation many lives are in peril. Luckily, the climate was better there. There is increased cruise traffic off the west coast of Scotland. Where are the tug boats or the security to ensure that such a situation would not turn into a human catastrophe? We talk about environmental catastrophes, but we have to be aware of human catastrophes. The Government are making a U-turn, but I hope that they carry on steaming further south and think of the Hebrides and the west coast too."}, {"speaker": "Mr Goodwill:", "speech": "      I have already made it very clear that we have two considerations in terms of the marine environment and pollution, particularly from vessels carrying oil, but there is also the potential loss of life from vessels that cannot receive timely assistance."}]
