Gentleman that the issue of child protection has been very much at the core of all our humanitarian responses, not least, most recently, in Syria.

We need to go beyond providing traditional lifesaving support to meet such broader needs\u2014not just jobs, as he says, but getting children into schools. The Syria conference tomorrow is a key moment not just to respond to that crisis, but, more broadly, to show a new model of responding to protracted humanitarian crises around the world.

Friend is absolutely right. In fact, when I had the privilege of chairing the UN Security Council last October, the issue we talked about was the need for the international community and the Security Council itself to look at fragile countries before conflict hits and perhaps to have better early warning systems, whether on human rights or any other area, to highlight where we need to do work in advance to keep peace and stability, rather than having the costly after-effects of responding to war."}, {"speaker": "Jeremy Lefroy (Stafford) (Con):", "speech": "      What work is my right hon.

At the moment, I would describe the humanitarian system as a hospital that only has an accident and emergency department. From the start of such crises, we need not only to think ahead about how we can deal with the day-to-day challenges that refugees and people affected face, but to begin to build in long-term solutions so that they can get their lives back on track.

More broadly, on the relocation scheme we have put in place, this is the right way to help vulnerable refugees to relocate out of the region if they need to. We are working with UN agencies to identify the most vulnerable people and are talking to them about how that can be extended to unaccompanied children. The good news is that because of the hard work of agencies such as UNICEF, which are funded by the UK, the overwhelming number of children\u2014more than 85%\u2014who arrive in countries such as Jordan and Lebanon unaccompanied are reunited with their families."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) (Con):", "speech": "   3.

I welcome DFID\u2019s support for household solar power, but how does it plan to expand that\u2014for example, through clean cooking technology\u2014and what steps is it taking to prioritise clean energy across the board in developing countries, rather than carbon-intensive and fossil fuel generation, to ensure that we do not undermine the climate change targets?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Hurd:", "speech": "      Yes, I mentioned the Energy Africa campaign, and that and the household solar system is just one piece of DFID\u2019s offer to Africa, which totals more than \u00a31.5 billion of investment.

That is the situation, and what we have said is that in future the work-related activity group should be paid at the same rate as jobseekers allowance, but that is for future claimants, not existing claimants, who continue to be paid at the same rate.

He will find that Macmillan Cancer Support, Rethink Mental Illness and Parkinson\u2019s UK are all united in opposing this cut because of the effect it will have on people with a range of serious conditions.

We are investing in vital transport infrastructure, not least the vital roads to the west country, and improving rail links as well, as I saw for myself yesterday in Chippenham.

Fewer people are aware of the fact that, through our normal asylum processes, we took around 2,500 unaccompanied children last year.

For the first time, the seven-year financial perspective shows that the budget over the next seven years will be lower than over the last seven years, so there is a real-terms cut\u2014something no one thought it would be possible to achieve. The exact amount of money we give depends on the growth and success of our economy.

I believe that it is. It is very important that we are clear that the core competences such as policing and our intelligence services are for this House and our Government to decide on, but of course there are ways in which we can co-operate in Europe to make ourselves safer, such as making sure that we know when criminals are crossing borders and making sure that we exchange passenger name records and the rest to keep us safe. That is why, when we opted out of the justice and home affairs powers, repatriating about 100 powers to Britain, we stayed in the ones that really matter in respect of keeping us safe.

I think that the peace process is secure and we must keep going with it, and I believe that the Taoiseach is a friend of the United Kingdom. He spoke up very strongly for Britain at the European Council, and I think he was quite influential in trying to build good will, and saying that we in the European Union should recognise that if a country has a national interest at stake and needs things fixed, we must be a flexible enough organisation, because otherwise we will not be able to sort those things out."}, {"speaker": "Philip Davies (Shipley) (Con):", "speech": "      The Prime Minister has said that if we vote to leave the EU, he would want to continue as Prime Minister\u2014a combination that I would fully support.

Would we be better off in a situation such as the one the EU has with Norway and Iceland? I have started talking about some of those alternatives.

Don\u2019t tell me that \u00a36,000 is not quite a major financial inducement. I think that more than 10,000 people are getting over \u00a310,000 a year, and because people get instant access to our benefits system, it is an unnatural pull and draw to our country.

As the document sets out, we are not in the euro, we are not participating in Schengen, we keep our own border controls, we choose whether to participate in measures of freedom, security and justice. We opted out of the justice and home affairs area, and now we are opted out, as it were, of ever closer union. Our membership is different, and we need to make that case strongly as we go forward."}, {"speaker": "Ms Margaret Ritchie (South Down) (SDLP):", "speech": "      Given that the south of Ireland is by far Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest export market, will the Prime Minister tell us what assessment he has made of the impact that leaving the European Union would have on the land border in Ireland? Can he tell us whether continued free movement in Ireland can be guaranteed, and has he assessed the damage that a customs border could cause to Northern Ireland\u2019s economic security?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      Those are important questions. I think I am right in saying that the amendments to the European Referendum Bill\u2014now the 2015 Act\u2014that were agreed in the House of Lords and were then, I think, accepted here require the Government to produce a series of documents concerning the reform proposals, the alternatives to membership, and the obligations and rights that attach to membership of the European Union. I think that, through a process involving those documents, we should address a very important question that clearly affects one part of the United Kingdom quite intensely."}, {"speaker": "Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset) (Con):", "speech": "      In 2014-15, 183,000 economic migrants came from the European Union, none of whom would have been deterred by anything we have heard so far. Ever closer union may be taken out of the preamble, but it remains in the essential text of all the treaties. On protecting the \u201ceuro-outs\u201d, all that will happen is that there will be a discussion\u2014and there are plenty of discussions in the European Union\u2014and, on competitiveness, that has been part of the European Union\u2019s own ambition since the Lisbon agenda of 1999."}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      My hon.

Key to that success is inward investment, including investment by Jaguar Land Rover in the 3,000-strong Jaguar factory in my constituency, and key to inward investment is continuing membership of the European Union. Does the Prime Minister agree that it is strongly in the best interests of midlands workers that we remain part of Europe?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      Provided that we secure the agreement that we need, yes, of course I do. We are seeing an industrial renaissance in the west midlands, much of it involving the automotive industry. I have had a number of meetings with car manufacturers in recent days: I saw representatives of Toyota and Ford yesterday, I have had conversations with Jaguar Land Rover and others, and I was with BMW representatives in Germany recently. They have all made the point that Britain is a great centre for the manufacture of cars, and of engines in particular. That is relevant to the issue of the standards set in Europe and our being a rule maker and not a rule taker, which is very important for our auto industry."}, {"speaker": "Mr John Baron (Basildon and Billericay) (Con):", "speech": "      Following the Prime Minister\u2019s response to my recent parliamentary question, I have taken his advice and cleared the diary for a debate in the Chamber tomorrow on parliamentary sovereignty. Given the importance of sovereignty to the EU negotiations, will he join us for that debate, and, perhaps, respond to it on behalf of the Government?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      I am very sorry, but I have not been able to clear my own diary. Tomorrow is the Syria conference. In fact, many people will arrive tonight\u2014more than 30 Presidents and Prime Ministers, I believe. The aim is to raise twice as much for the Syria refugee appeal this year as we did last year. However, I know that my hon.

However, although the Prime Minister said in his statement that the emergency brake would apply immediately after the EU referendum, it was reported yesterday that the process would take at least 18 months. Will the Prime Minister make clear which is the case, and tell us whether he will report on any other transitional arrangements relating to other measures?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      What I said was that because this measure does not rely on changes in the treaty but will be in European legislation, it can enter into force relatively shortly after the referendum. It will require some legislation, but, as I said earlier, the leader of one of the biggest parties in the European Parliament said that it could be a matter of months, because the process can be accelerated. It just goes to show how much we need to bind everyone into the agreement that we hope to achieve in the coming weeks, so that the Parliament can pass the legislation as swiftly as possible."}, {"speaker": "Nick Herbert (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):", "speech": "      Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the biggest concerns about the direction of travel in the European Union is that countries within it, the eurozone members, wish to integrate more deeply in order to protect their currency? We have our own currency, but an incredibly important part of my right hon. Friend\u2019s negotiation ambition was that we should be protected from any discriminatory measure that might result from those countries\u2019 ability to integrate more closely. Is that not why this proposed package is indeed significant? Is it not the case that it does protect us, and that not only are there now two different speeds, but we have a different destination from our European partners, which puts us in a relatively advantageous position?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      Let me make two points. First, I think that the reference to a different destination is significant. People have often talked about Europe moving at different speeds, but for the first time it is being said that we may not all be trying to achieve the same ends, and I think that that is very important."}, {"speaker": "Phil Wilson (Sedgefield) (Lab):", "speech": "      More than 80% of businesses in my constituency want to stay in the EU. More than 50% of the jobs are linked to trade with the EU. Our membership is vital to jobs, prosperity and security, and that is why Labour Members are united in campaigning to stay in Europe. Do we not need to end the uncertainty, have the referendum as soon as possible, and campaign to stay in the EU?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      Obviously I am keen to end the uncertainty, but I am not in any hurry if we cannot get the right deal.

Already the reform of the common fisheries policy has led to some improvement, but there is more to be done. On the rules that manufacturers face, I have set out how we will cut bureaucracy. The documents also address directly the problem between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland of sham marriages and people trying to get round our immigration controls, but we now need to carry them into force."}, {"speaker": "Tom Pursglove (Corby) (Con):", "speech": "      The Prime Minister is trying his best to renegotiate our position, but would he not agree that the reforms, as they stand, do nothing to make the immigration system in this country fairer to people, regardless of where in the world they come from?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      I think they do make it fairer. As I explained in the statement, it has for years been frustrating that we cannot apply some of the rules for British citizens marrying foreign nationals to EU citizens marrying foreign nationals. The agreement opens the way to ensuring that we can. All sorts of sham marriages, fraudsters, criminals and others who have been getting round our immigration controls will no longer be able to do so."}, {"speaker": "Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh South West) (SNP):", "speech": "     The Sunday Times has reported that, as part of the negotiations and his plan to restore the sovereignty of Parliament, the Prime Minister is seeking to deny UK citizens access to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the EU charter. Does he appreciate that, as stated in the well-known case of MacCormick v. Lord Advocate, the doctrine of the sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle? In Scotland, the people are sovereign, and they do not want their human rights protections reduced."}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      People in our country had fundamental rights long before the EU charter of fundamental rights was even thought of, so we do not need these documents in force in Britain.

All four tranches of the agreement are important to all our constituents, but the most significant is the protection for non-euro countries. Will the Prime Minister assure the House that he will look at the detail\u2014the devil is in the detail\u2014to make sure that there are no loopholes and that, as the eurozone countries integrate, we are protected and not discriminated against?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      I will certainly do that. It will be a complex negotiation. The eurozone counties want the ability to integrate further and to know that we are not trying to block the action they need to take, but clearly we want to make sure that we, as members of the single market, are not disadvantaged."}, {"speaker": "Diana Johnson (Kingston upon Hull North) (Lab):", "speech": "      I am sure the Prime Minister will welcome today\u2019s news that the largest offshore wind farm in the world is to be built off the east Yorkshire coast by DONG Energy and Siemens. This will create up to 2,000 jobs in the Humber estuary and result in \u00a36 billion of investment. Does this not show that, whatever the debate and frustrations around the right terms, it is in our country\u2019s economic interest to be part of, and engaged in, the EU as a leading player?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      I am delighted with that news, because the Government have given great support to Siemens and DONG Energy. We have\u2014I think\u2014the biggest offshore wind market in the world, because we have provided the regulatory certainty the industry needed. In the east of England, that has achieved not just one big factory, but the industrial regeneration of all the related industries. Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum, we have to make Britain the best place in the world to invest and grow a business.

Had he gone for treaty change, could it not have been scuppered by referendums in France, Netherlands, Ireland and other EU member states whose publics might come to a different view from that of the British public?"}, {"speaker": "The Prime Minister:", "speech": "      I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. Clearly, if agreed, this will be a legally binding arrangement, for the reasons I have given, but we are aiming in it for treaty change\u2014on those things that need to change\u2014the next time the treaties are altered.

Friend is absolutely right that, outside the EU, one option would be to take our seat at the WTO. The only problem is that the WTO has not signed many trade agreements in recent years. Those have tended to be bilateral agreements, such as the EU agreement with Canada, which we hope is about to come in, and that with Korea. Of course, Britain could, independently, sign trade agreements, but we have to weigh up how much influence Britain has as a member of the EU\u2014a market of 500 million people\u2014when negotiating the biggest and best trade deals with the fastest-growing countries in the world."}, {"speaker": "Mr Speaker:", "speech": "      I call Brendan O\u2019Hara.

Friend. First, this is not coming at the time of a more general treaty change; it is a one-off. We are the first Government, and I am the first Prime Minister, I can think of who from a standing start have achieved a unilateral agreement for the good of their country inside the EU. I do not think it is threadbare; as others have said, it is very solid. I am sure that treaty changes will be coming down the track\u2014the process of reform is never fully completed\u2014but there is no danger, once the agreement is signed and, I hope, confirmed in a referendum, of Europe running away with a whole lot of other plans for Britain, because we have the referendum lock.

Lady that reassurance in terms of those guarantees and also the action we have taken domestically on things like shared parental leave, which I am very proud of and makes Britain a more family-friendly country.

That figure includes 279 of its European, middle eastern and African directors, compared with Dublin, where it has 79 such directors.

The report it published in February of last year identifies 42 separate measures that the Government have taken since 2010 to clamp down on corporation tax avoidance and evasion. They are forecast to raise \u00a334 billion. I strongly welcome the measures that the Financial Secretary and his colleagues have taken in this area, which include the diverted profits tax and the general anti-abuse rule. The Government have also increased capital gains tax from 18% to 26%, dealing with a loophole that was being widely exploited by some hedge funds to end up paying rates of tax below that of their cleaners. The Government\u2019s record in this area does bear scrutiny. Indeed, Richard Murphy, who describes himself as the \u201cfather of Corbynomics\u201d declared himself pleased and surprised at the progress made in this area since 2010, which includes the BEPS initiative, which the UK Government have been strongly pushing."}, {"speaker": "Wes Streeting (Ilford North) (Lab):", "speech": "      I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate.

I want this country to be a good place to do business and to set up a business, and to continue to lead the world with competitive tax rates."}, {"speaker": "Mr Gauke:", "speech": "      Just to be clear, the statutory rate is 20% and that applies to everybody. There are businesses that will have a lower effective rate, entirely lawfully and in accordance with the spirit of the law, because, for example, they make use of capital allowances or they might have losses that they are making use of. Someone having an effective rate below the statutory rate does not mean that they are conducting avoidance activity."}, {"speaker": "Wes Streeting:", "speech": "      That is a fair point, but of course many tax experts have estimated that Google is paying an effective tax rate of 3%. If that is not the case, we need to see the numbers that give us that assurance. We do not doubt the difficulties here. In an increasingly globalised world, where intellectual property and the growth of internet companies makes this more important in the debate about tax, these are difficult issues to grasp, but there is no hint of fairness or transparency about this deal, and that is what we are seeking with this debate."}, {"speaker": "Kevin Hollinrake (Thirsk and Malton) (Con):", "speech": "      First, let me draw the House\u2019s attention to my entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests.

He is also right to suggest that this is not just about a fiscal framework for Scotland. It is important for these negotiations to run in parallel with the Scotland Bill, but they also have significant implications for the rest of the United Kingdom.

One key plank of the Smith agreement was intergovernmental relations, and without that transparency we cannot see whether intergovernmental relations are actually working.
