On that basis\u2014I believed that the Prime Minister thought that, too\u2014I have kept my counsel, but what the Minister has offered today on free movement is \u201cimportant ideas\u201d from Mr Tusk.

Clearly, it will need the agreement of 27 other Heads of Government at the European Council, and I cannot stand here and take that for granted.

However, I would hint to the right hon. Gentleman that if he wants to have a sense of how the process might work, he should probably consult article 7(1) of protocol 2.

Through him, may I urge the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to consider all resources to tackle the outbreak of this virus, for which there is no test, cure or vaccine?

Degree apprenticeships are going to be a massive opportunity for our universities and for our public sectors. Employers have told me that they are likely to run graduate recruitment alongside apprenticeships, as a means of using the apprenticeship levy funds. That is a real opportunity for universities, because a lot of those employers will be looking for degree apprenticeships. They want to hire the best people as apprentices at a young age, getting them into their company earlier, so that they can develop their skills, build loyalty and enhance productivity.

I suggest that Ministers in the Department and other Members read an excellent article in The Publican\u2019s Morning Advertiser by Robert Sayles, published on 6 January 2015, which exposes part of the myth that has been created by pubcos and their supporters. For instance, in 2015 Enterprise Inns invested \u00a366 million\u2014which sounds a lot, but only amounts to \u00a313,200 per pub across the estate\u2014and, interestingly, made a loss of \u00a366 million at the same time, which it can offset against tax.

I welcome that role, because some small businesses in my constituency complain frequently about payment problems and this allows me to reassure them and, in particular, the Federation of Small Businesses, that meaningful action has been taken. The Bill says that the commissioner will be giving out advice, and that is a good thing. I am not sure about the scope of this \u201cadvice\u201d, but it has to include encouraging small businesses to grow and advice on how that growth might take place. This should be within the context of an interesting speech made by Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, who has noted that we need to ensure that firms think about long-term planning and strategic investment, rather than just exit routes, dividend payments and so forth.

I have worked with and for small businesses, including our family manufacturing business, which we started thanks to the enterprise allowance scheme."}, {"speaker": "Kit Malthouse (North West Hampshire) (Con):", "speech": "      I draw the House\u2019s attention to my entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests, as the proud founder and owner of a small business, which, miraculously, has now been going for 20 years."}, {"speaker": "Seema Kennedy (South Ribble) (Con):", "speech": "      I draw Members\u2019 attention to my entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests."}, {"speaker": "Lucy Frazer (South East Cambridgeshire) (Con):", "speech": "      Small businesses are critical to our economy and make up 99% of businesses nationally, and the Bill is designed to assist them. I want to focus on the resolution of disputes and debt collection, and I refer to my entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests. As a barrister who specialises in business law, and insolvency in particular, I have seen at first hand the impact that uncollected debts can have on a company."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) (Con):", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is giving a great speech with her experience in insolvency. Does she agree that companies do not go bankrupt because they run out of profit; they go bankrupt because they run out of money, and late payment is part of that?"}, {"speaker": "Lucy Frazer:", "speech": "      That is absolutely right. Often, the cause is cash-flow insolvency, which is a test of insolvency, as well as the balance sheet."}, {"speaker": "Kevin Brennan (Cardiff West) (Lab):", "speech": "      We have had a very good debate, with 25 speakers from the Back Benches. I congratulate everybody on their contributions. I will not go through them all because of the time available, but I will say it has been a very interesting debate."}, {"speaker": "The Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise (Anna Soubry):", "speech": "      I congratulate everybody\u2014and I mean everybody\u2014who has contributed to what I believe has been a very good debate. I am going to look at the areas of contention and the particular topics in respect of which hon. Members have made good points and raised good concerns. I shall not go through all the clauses and topics in the Bill, but deal with it in the way I have suggested."}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing):", "speech": "      Order. The right hon. Lady is right: there is a lot of chuntering, and if it gets any louder, I will have to stop it."}, {"speaker": "Anna Soubry:", "speech": "      Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. We do not like chuntering, do we?"}, {"speaker": "Toby Perkins:", "speech": "      Will the Minister give way?"}, {"speaker": "Anna Soubry:", "speech": "      I will give way briefly, but I will take no more interventions after that."}, {"speaker": "Toby Perkins:", "speech": "      What the Minister is saying, and what she is setting out to do in regard to Sunday trading, is entirely wrong, but something even more important is happening here. For the first time ever, workers\u2019 rights are being devolved, and will become different in different areas."}, {"speaker": "Anna Soubry:", "speech": "      They will not be devolved. Let me make that absolutely clear. We will introduce legislation for all work that will affect any worker working on a Sunday\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Ms Angela Eagle:", "speech": "      On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Minister is spending time talking about provisions that no one but her has seen, because they are not in the Bill. How can that be in order?"}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing):", "speech": "      The Minister can choose what she wants to talk about as long as it is related to the Bill. When it is not related to the Bill, I will stop her."}, {"speaker": "Anna Soubry:", "speech": "      Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I specifically wanted to deal with those points, because I think that the hon. Member for Strangford made them better than anyone else."}, {"speaker": "Lady Hermon (North Down) (Ind):", "speech": "      On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker\u2014[Interruption.]"}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing):", "speech": "      Order. The House must be quiet, as I am trying to hear a point of order."}, {"speaker": "Lady Hermon:", "speech": "      I am most grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for accepting this important point of order. I think that this is the first time that this has arisen. I am in no way challenging the certification by the Speaker of provisions in this Bill as exclusively English or English and Welsh only. The guidance I seek relates to the Order Paper published for today\u2019s business, which on page 6, under the title \u201cEnterprise Bill [Lords]: Second Reading\u201d, gives a note of Mr Speaker\u2019s certification. At the very end, it states:"}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker:", "speech": "      I am grateful to the hon. Lady for drawing her concerns to the attention of the House and to my attention, and I will, of course, pass that on to Mr Speaker."}, {"speaker": "The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons (Dr Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey):", "speech": "      I beg to move,"}, {"speaker": "Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab):", "speech": "      I do not intend to delay the House for very long either. I think the Deputy Leader of the House has got a bit of a cold and has been in bed all day, so we are very grateful to her for managing to struggle in this evening. The phrase in Wales is that she has been \u201cbad in bed\u201d\u2014though not, I think, under the doctors in this case."}, {"speaker": "Pete Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP):", "speech": "      I will be even briefer than the Deputy Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House in welcoming, on behalf of those on the SNP Benches, both these appointments\u2014Dame Janet Gaymer, who has become a full-time member of the Commission, and Jane McCall. I am told by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie), who is of course a distinguished member of the House of Commons Commission, that they will bring invaluable external expertise to its work, and this House will appreciate and respect that. I have to say that I was not familiar with these individuals, but having examined their CVs in great detail in the 10 minutes since I was notified of the fact that they were going to be appointed, I can say that the House has made a brave and courageous, but correct, decision in appointing them."}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing):", "speech": "      With the leave of the House, we shall take motions 6 and 7 together."}, {"speaker": "Chris Evans (Islwyn) (Lab/Co-op):", "speech": "      Thank you for calling me to speak, Madam Deputy Speaker; it is a pleasure. I have been in this House for six years in May, and this is the first time I have ever been granted an end-of-day Adjournment debate."}, {"speaker": "Julian Knight (Solihull) (Con):", "speech": "      I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate on a very important topic. I support his call for real-time credit scoring, which needs to be explored further. In my previous occupation as a financial journalist, I dealt with a lady who got into \u00a3107,000 of debt in three days, following a relationship breakdown. If real-time credit scoring had been in place on the high street, she would not have got into such enormous debt, which caused further mental health issues. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reflect on that."}, {"speaker": "Chris Evans:", "speech": "      I will develop that argument further. The hon. Gentleman identifies the nub of the problem\u2014the delay in credit scoring needs to be addressed. That is common sense and I hope the Government will grasp the nettle."}, {"speaker": "Yvonne Fovargue (Makerfield) (Lab):", "speech": "      I congratulate my hon. Friend on obtaining this debate. Does he agree that it is not just consumers who would benefit, but new entrants to the market who are lending for the medium term would be able to come in without having to buy two databases: the payday loan database, which operates   "}, {"speaker": "Chris Evans:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend speaks with some expertise. I pay tribute to the amount of work she has done on payday lending and raising the issues associated with it. She is right. The real problem is that the banks have a stranglehold on lending. They jealously guard their data and they are suspicious of the Data Protection Act. They therefore keep out of the market major competitors who could bring down interest rates, which is what we all want to see."}, {"speaker": "Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP):", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman is very gracious and I thank him for giving way. Credit risk is one of the top issues in financial services and there is a need for services to be automated. Is there a possibility through real-time credit scoring to provide new, exciting jobs in a well-paid high-end market? That would be a plus, if it was done in the right way."}, {"speaker": "Chris Evans:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman is right. The more competitors there are in the market, the more jobs and the more specialised jobs there will be. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman, who speaks on every single topic. We have often joked privately that Westminster Hall is his lounge in the morning, as he speaks there so often. Coming from Northern Ireland and Wales, which have great similarities\u2014both are heavily reliant on public sector jobs\u2014the hon. Gentleman and I know that real-time data sharing and more competitors in the market would bring the private sector jobs that areas such as mine, his and the north-east are crying out for."}, {"speaker": "The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Harriett Baldwin):", "speech": "      I congratulate the hon. Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans) on securing this very interesting debate. I want to assure him that my key priority as Economic Secretary is to ensure that financial services are on the side of people who work hard and who want to do the right thing and get on in life. Financial services should help people to achieve their aspirations at every stage of their lives, whether they are saving for their first home, taking out a mortgage, buying a car or saving and investing for their retirement."}]
