It is a task that has been attempted since the bankers\u2019 crisis of 2008, but today the Government are threatening to set back this task."}, {"speaker": "John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con):", "speech": "      The hon.

Gentleman for his intervention. At the time, Conservative Members were calling for even lighter regulation, but what is clear, and what I will illustrate, is that Labour Members have learnt the lessons of the banking crisis but that this Bill shows they have not been learnt by Conservative Members. Eight years on, bankers\u2019 behaviour and bankers\u2019 bonuses remain in the news. Court cases and institutional fines continue, with hundreds of millions of pounds-worth of fines issued, yet still only one person is in prison, despite all the damage done. Despite a series of commissions and reviews, there remains too little evidence that the lessons of the bankers\u2019 crisis have been learnt. We should all know that the public remain angry at what a number of top bankers did to our economy and our society."}, {"speaker": "Kelvin Hopkins:", "speech": "      My hon.

Troublingly, the people who now say there is no risk of a financial crisis ever again were the very same people in the very same sector who were saying before 2008 that everything was fine and there was no risk of disaster at the time. Sadly, how wrong they were! Despite what the bankers did to our economy and our society, about which there was entirely justified anger among the population, the Chancellor has cunningly turned the bankers\u2019 crisis into a crisis of public spending, and has adopted a policy of spending cuts to vital services to which there seems to be no end in sight. In looking at this Bill, it appears that the Chancellor believes that he can now turn back the clock in the banking and financial sector."}, {"speaker": "Sammy Wilson (East Antrim) (DUP):", "speech": "      At the conclusion of her speech, the Minister indicated that by voting against the Second Reading of this Bill Members would be putting the public at risk from further bank abuses.

It is possible for bankers to provide a tick-box operation, which their lawyers have advised them on, to prove that they have undertaken every possible measure to prevent such action. It is therefore very easy for them to get around the reverse burden of proof legislation. The point behind reversing that legislation, which was given by Andrew Bailey and by the Governor of the Bank of England and some of the Bank\u2019s lawyers, is that there cannot be a tick-box operation to show that they have complied with the rules because they involve a much more esoteric way of running the bank.

Although I agree that ideally we need to move towards a much more competitive world in the banking sphere, it is also worth reflecting that one reason why we have not had a great upsurge of challenger banks is because\u2014at least in the retail banking sector\u2014the banking world is insufficiently profitable to make it worth while for such competitors to come through. One reason for that is because there is ever more regulation and compliance in the retail world. It is therefore perhaps predictable that the furore surrounding this Bill has been concentrated on the role in the institutional architecture of the Financial Conduct Authority, and the changes that have already been referred to regarding the Government\u2019s original proposals on the senior managers\u2019 regime."}, {"speaker": "George Kerevan:", "speech": "      Is the right hon.

Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) on securing the debate."}, {"speaker": "Graham Stuart:", "speech": "      I wonder whether there has been a reduction in small companies. Heavy regulation often favours larger organisations, so it cuts out the entrepreneurial and small business in a market town in my constituency above a shop, while it favours the large companies, which then gouge the public for higher fees. Does my hon. Friend agree?"}, {"speaker": "Craig Tracey:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and that was indeed my experience. I was coming on to say how many firms have disappeared since regulation was introduced. To put it into context, in my final years as a broker, 80% of my time was spent working on compliance rather than being productive in my business. That was a small brokerage providing a valuable high street presence to people who needed access to somebody they knew and trusted. A clear case can be made that firms that abide by the rules should not be the ones that pay for the misbehaviours and increased regulation caused by other firms."}, {"speaker": "Mr Mark Williams (Ceredigion) (LD):", "speech": "      I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) for his persistence in pursuing this cause. I counted three debates that he had initiated with the support of the Backbench Business Committee, but he reminded us that there have now been four. I spoke in the first three, and I now speak again on behalf of my constituents who have been affected specifically by the mis-selling of interest rate swap products. Many of them have been denied justice, notably those who were sold tailored business loans or hidden swaps, largely by Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank, and who have been denied any semblance of justice."}, {"speaker": "Mr Gary Streeter (South West Devon) (Con):", "speech": "      I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) on securing this debate and on his tenacity in pursuing this issue. I fully support the motion. I am not at all happy with the FCA\u2019s performance in resolving the swap issue. I have had experience of several constituency cases that have revealed a very slow process with insufficient redress, and the independent review process appears to be anything but independent. So I have no confidence at all in this FCA scheme."}, {"speaker": "Daniel Kawczynski:", "speech": "      Does my hon. Friend agree that the swaps\u2014the derivatives\u2014were deliberately made to be so complicated that our constituents would have no opportunity to understand them?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Streeter:", "speech": "      I suspect that that is the case\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lindsay Hoyle):", "speech": "      Order.

Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) for securing this important debate on the future of the FCA, especially in the light of recent perceived failings, and for his work on the all-party group on the Connaught Income Fund, series 1, which has done so much good work, without, sadly, getting this resolved so far."}, {"speaker": "Several hon.

Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) for his hard work on this issue. Does my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (William Wragg) agree that the real tragedy of many of the scenarios that have been played out in constituencies up and down the country is that it is not simply businesses or individuals who suffer. The suffering is also felt by a whole range of employees, whose jobs have been liquidated in this way by the banks?"}, {"speaker": "William Wragg:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that point. Too often, perhaps, we focus on the concerns of businessmen, but we should also focus on the people they employee, and who keep the economy of this country going."}, {"speaker": "Richard Arkless (Dumfries and Galloway) (SNP):", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman is making a compelling case and I echo his sentiments. My constituent, Victor Singh, owns a property company in exactly the same position. His fear is that the report is being delayed by RBS as a tactic to delay the litigation and reach a more favourable position for the bank. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the House should use this debate to call on the FCA to publish that report as soon as possible so that the litigants can have a fair hearing?"}, {"speaker": "William Wragg:", "speech": "      I thank the hon. Gentleman for that timely intervention. I agree with him to the extent that I hope the voice of the House this evening will be heard loud and clear, and that the FCA will proceed with a degree of alacrity that it has so far not shown."}, {"speaker": "Several hon.

The delays inherent in this case are making it difficult for people in all kinds of situations to have justice and clarity."}, {"speaker": "Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh South West) (SNP):", "speech": "      The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (James Berry) raised the case of an independent financial adviser. Does my hon. Friend share my concern that independent financial advisers, many of whom were also investors in the fund, risk continuing to be blamed for losses relating to it because of the FCA\u2019s continuing failure to investigate within a reasonable timescale?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsten Oswald:", "speech": "      I agree with my hon. and learned Friend. The system regulated by the FCA, which the Chancellor wants people to rely on, continues to fail to provide all these investors with compensation, or even an explanation, for their loss."}, {"speaker": "Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset) (Con):", "speech": "      It is a pleasure to follow the hon.

I have always thought that was probably rather difficult anyway, so \u201cm\u00e9nage\u201d is a better term."}, {"speaker": "Guto Bebb:", "speech": "      I appreciate the points my hon. Friend is making\u2014they are entirely reasonable\u2014but I think that the difference between the FSA and FCA is being over-emphasised. The people who were FSA officers when the all-party group on interest rate swap mis-selling was established were the same people as the FCA officers who attended our first meeting after the FCA was established. I think that the degree of change is being overstated."}, {"speaker": "Mr Rees-Mogg:", "speech": "      I do not agree with my hon. Friend on this occasion. Inevitably, some employees remained the same. It would have been extraordinary if all the regulators at the FSA had been fired and sent off to the great regulatory house in the sky. The powers and the responsibilities of the FCA were changed and, indeed, it has carried out an investigation."}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge (South Suffolk) (Con):", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is making a typically powerful speech and I agree with much of his argument, but does he not accept that we are here primarily to represent our constituents and that the reason so many Members are upset with the FCA is that it is not giving redress? The time it is taking is so frustrating and the motion puts pressure on it to provide redress."}, {"speaker": "Mr Rees-Mogg:", "speech": "      I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, because I think there is a difficulty with time. Reference has been made to the HBOS report, which took a long time to come forward. Again, it started under the FSA, and the failures were of the FSA, not of the FCA. For a body that has been going for only three years, such a timespan is perhaps not that unreasonable, given that for two of those years it was making a specific investigation."}, {"speaker": "Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lindsay Hoyle):", "speech": "      Order.

Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) for the work that he has done through the all-party parliamentary group and more widely. People whom I knew in a previous life before I came to this place are very appreciative of that work. I will address my remarks primarily to the fact that the FCA process of redress simply does not work for businesses that are forced into insolvency as a result of being mis-sold interest rate hedging products. The concept of hedging is well understood to mitigate risk, but those products were structured to be a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d for the banks."}, {"speaker": "Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lindsay Hoyle):", "speech": "      Order."}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge (South Suffolk) (Con):", "speech": "      I add my congratulations to my hon.
