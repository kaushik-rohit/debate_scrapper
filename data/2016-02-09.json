Member for Glasgow South West (Chris Stephens) in all seriousness is that he should wend his way to the Table Office and table a written question on the matter. If, when he receives a response, the fog has not lifted, I have a feeling that he will turn up at business questions on a Thursday to press for an early statement or debate on that matter.

The issue needs to be taken very seriously by the Government, and cannot be dismissed lightly or set aside easily, given the breadth of support that it attracts from all parties, including the major parties mentioned by the hon.

Has her party expressed a view on that matter, or does she believe that she and I should discuss it, with a view to when this referendum should be?"}, {"speaker": "Pat Glass:", "speech": "      The hon.

One of my biggest concerns as a Eurosceptic is that we constantly have to ask 28 countries what they think.

Instead, we see short-termism over green energy cuts, for example, and over providing the certainty that businesses of any kind need to plan. That includes housing associations, which are charities but which have, in many ways, the acumen and the outlook of the private sector. If we reduce their income, their certainty and their confidence in their balance sheets, they will build less and provide fewer services.

On a party political point, for the council to allow the first options paper to come out on 23 December, when people were doing their Christmas shopping\u2014he says that councils must take people with them on this important issue\u2014was disingenuous at local level."}, {"speaker": "Tim Farron:", "speech": "      That is a staggering intervention from an hon.

Friend makes a very good point, particularly on the excellent Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015. He put a great deal of passion and determination into that. He is delivering something that the Housing and Planning Bill builds on and underpins to ensure a real step-change. It will help not just by providing people with more opportunities to own their own home, but by providing an opportunity for the reinvigoration of small and medium-size local builders that we all want to see. A few weeks\u2019 ago, we announced an expansion of direct commissioning, which will go even further to deliver that."}, {"speaker": "Tim Farron:", "speech": "      The Minister refers to housing associations and the National Housing Federation\u2019s involvement in discussions in putting together the Housing and Planning Bill.

The Housing and Planning Bill does not legislate for that. It underpins the agreement by providing the legal ability to pay the housing associations for discounts. Exemptions are outlined in the voluntary agreement, so I suggest the hon. Gentleman reads it. In rural areas, for example, housing associations will be able to use the exemptions. After we reinvigorated the scheme in 2012 for council tenants in London, 536 additional homes were sold in the first year, and 1,139 were built. For clarity, that is two-for-one replacement. That success has the potential to be repeated on a much grander scale. Where buyers can buy, builders will build, and we can support the aspiration of hard-working people. That will be true for right to buy, starter homes and Help to Buy. Those plans are at the heart of our ambition to build 1 million more new homes, but we have made it clear that we must do more in all areas of housing supply."}, {"speaker": "Tim Farron:", "speech": "      After this, I promise to leave the Minister alone for a while.

Friend highlights an important point. What the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale seems to be asking for with the right to buy and, to an extent, in the arguments that he made about starter homes, is second-class ownership, and I do not support that. If someone owns their home they should have the same rights as anyone else. It is sometimes tiresome to hear people who own their home explain why we should not let someone else have the chance to do so. The Housing and Planning Bill is part of our work to drive up the housing supply and home ownership, and it will give house builders and local decision makers the tools and confidence to deliver more homes."}, {"speaker": "Mr Bacon:", "speech": "      Before the Minister moves on, this issue riles a lot of us, as it riles him. The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) made the point that buying a house and renting it out at some point in the future was bad per se. At the same time, we are supposed to take measures to encourage the private rented sector. Is it not a good thing if more houses are made available for rent?

There is not just one problem. I should like to continue with my speech, if the hon.

What is more worrying, however, is the fact that developers can deliver starter homes to help the few, rather than affordable homes that would help the many.

Everyone will get a chance to speak if each hon. Member, out of courtesy for other hon. Members, keeps to somewhere between eight and nine minutes. You can work it out by adding eight minutes on to the time on the clock up there. I look on this as a test of very simple year 3 arithmetic. People who can add on eight will get it right and people who cannot will get it wrong, and we will see who is who."}, {"speaker": "Stuart Andrew (Pudsey) (Con):", "speech": "      I think I am going to fail at the first hurdle, Madam Deputy Speaker."}, {"speaker": "Julian Sturdy (York Outer) (Con):", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right to talk about green-belt land. Does he agree that green-belt land also plays a key role in driving urban regeneration and in delivering a lot of our brownfield sites not only in Leeds, but in my city of York as well?"}, {"speaker": "Stuart Andrew:", "speech": "      I completely agree with my hon. Friend, and I will come on to that point in a minute."}, {"speaker": "Greg Mulholland (Leeds North West) (LD):", "speech": "      I thank the hon. Gentleman who is my neighbour for giving way. He and I agree on the Leeds City Council targets, but does he not accept that there is a real disconnect between what he would like and what Ministers say, and the reality of the Conservative Government\u2019s planning system and what it delivers? Does he not agree that our constituents are frustrated about that? Does he not acknowledge that, and is he raising it with Ministers?"}, {"speaker": "Stuart Andrew:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman knows that I have raised those issues on a number of occasions. Of course the plan must go before the inspector, and we will be making it very clear that much of what Leeds City Council is advocating goes against Government advice. We will make that point very strongly again during the inspection period."}, {"speaker": "Alison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP):", "speech": "      I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate on housing, because it is a clear example of a tale of two Governments and of the positive effect that the different approach taken by the SNP Scottish Government is having on housing provision in Scotland."}, {"speaker": "Mr Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):", "speech": "      It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss), because her leader at Westminster, the right hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson), was one of the sponsors of my Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Bill, which became law on 26 March 2015."}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend speaks with great passion on this issue, and that is wonderful. If councils take these lists seriously, will not that offer the opportunity that, when significant development sites come up, whole areas can be set aside for self-build?"}, {"speaker": "Mr Bacon:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The only thing I would question is his use of the word \u201cif\u201d. Councils have a legal obligation to take the lists seriously.   "}, {"speaker": "Kevin Foster (Torbay) (Con):", "speech": "      As always, my hon. Friend is speaking as a passionate advocate of self-build. He talks about local authorities taking this seriously. He will pleased to hear that my authority, Torbay Council, is already looking to identify sites for self-build projects."}, {"speaker": "Mr Bacon:", "speech": "      I am very pleased to hear that. There is quite a lot going on in the south-west, and I hope it will spread right across the country to all corners of our great kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Alison Thewliss:", "speech": "      Perhaps that is because shoes are not particularly expensive, whereas a flat in London can cost \u00a3500,000."}, {"speaker": "Mr Bacon:", "speech": "      The word \u201cexpensive\u201d is a function of supply and demand, and the word \u201caffordable\u201d is itself deeply laden. If there were enough supply, the price would not be as high relative to income. At present, the average cost of an average dwelling in South Norfolk and in Harlow is about 8.2 times the average income, while in Hertfordshire the average cost is 13.6 times the average income. If we had a market in which supply rose to meet demand, those statistics would not be so out of kilter. That is what we need to fix."}, {"speaker": "Mr Mark Williams (Ceredigion) (LD):", "speech": "      As a former teacher of year 3 children, I will be particularly mindful of your stipulation on time, Madam Deputy Speaker."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) (Con):", "speech": "      The long-term strength and vitality of the housing market is of great importance to North West Leicestershire. It is the base of three of the UK\u2019s leading house builders\u2014Barratt, Bloor and Davidsons\u2014and it is also the home to aggregate industries such as Midland Quarry Products, Breedon Aggregates and Lafarge, which produce a considerable amount of the UK\u2019s aggregates requirements. In addition, we have two of the largest and most efficient brick factories in Red Bank and Ibstock Brick. Indeed, it could be argued that no constituency has a greater vested interest in the health of the UK housing market."}, {"speaker": "Mr Bacon:", "speech": "      It sounds to me as though my hon. Friend has visited buildforlife.org.uk, the website of the all-party parliamentary group on self-build, custom and community housebuilding and place-making."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen:", "speech": "      Indeed. My hon. Friend will know that a couple of years ago, I hosted the Building for Life function in the House of Commons, which was attended by the Housing Minister of the time. This is something that I very much believe in. One of my sayings is that Building for Life is not just about building houses, but about building communities. That is what we are doing in North West Leicestershire."}, {"speaker": "Brandon Lewis:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend outlined clearly what a good Conservative authority can do to deliver housing. I would be very happy to meet him at an early opportunity to discuss the situation that his council is in, as it tries to do the right thing by its community."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen:", "speech": "      I thank the Minister for agreeing to a meeting. I hope that he and our Liberal Democrat colleagues will bear it in mind that if every constituency in the country was completing homes at the same rate as North West Leicestershire, there would be more than 450,000 new homes this year, which is one and a half times the Liberal Democrat target."}, {"speaker": "Bob Stewart (Beckenham) (Con):", "speech": "      With his great expertise and knowledge of house building, would my hon. Friend ever contemplate building on the green belt?"}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen:", "speech": "      There is no green belt in my constituency, but there is a green wedge, which is a valued area of separation between Coalville and the villages of Swannington, Whitwick and Thringstone. In a recent survey, it was claimed to be the most valued green space in the whole of Leicestershire. It is under threat from developers at the moment and we wish to defend it from that."}, {"speaker": "Bob Stewart:", "speech": "      So the answer is no."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Bridgen:", "speech": "      Indeed."}, {"speaker": "Greg Mulholland (Leeds North West) (LD):", "speech": "      It is a pleasure to take part in this debate and to follow the hon. Member for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen), and it is good to hear that positive things are happening. During debates on important subjects\u2014albeit on an Opposition day\u2014it is important to acknowledge the gravity of the challenge that we face as a nation in addressing the housing crisis. We must consider that in a serious way, rather than just score party political points."}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge:", "speech": "      The hon. Gentleman makes a very important point, with which I strongly agree, about institutional investment. Does he not accept that one of the big factors that will eventually lead to greater choice and supply in the private rental market is institutional money coming in and building large-scale development for rent, which is happening now across the country?"}, {"speaker": "Greg Mulholland:", "speech": "      That is an intelligent intervention and a sensible point. Of course I agree, but that does not build council houses and it does not give people hope. It creates more private rented accommodation, but it does not deal with the problem these people face."}, {"speaker": "Kelly Tolhurst (Rochester and Strood) (Con):", "speech": "      Would you agree with me that your council could take guidance from Medway Council, a Conservative-run council that has been building council houses for the first time in a long time? It has smashed its own targets on affordable housing, delivering far more than our percentage target over a number years. Do you think that your council could take advantage of Medway Council\u2019s experience in delivering in this area?"}, {"speaker": "Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing):", "speech": "      Order. I do not want to interrupt the hon. Lady, but this happened yesterday five times and it has happened today three times. When you use the word \u201cyou\u201d you are referring to the Chair. The hon. Gentleman is the hon. Gentleman and his council is his council. It is like the eight minutes\u2014you just use the third person. We are back to year 3 again."}, {"speaker": "Greg Mulholland:", "speech": "      Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I welcome the intervention from the hon. Lady, and indeed anything that will get Leeds City Council building more and using its powers. We need to learn from best practice everywhere and from councils of any colour."}, {"speaker": "Julian Knight (Solihull) (Con):", "speech": "      The crux of the problem that we face, and which we have faced for many years, is the fact that we do not build enough homes. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times we have built enough homes to meet the formation of new households, whether that is the result of divorce or the fact that we lead more solitary lives with more solitary households. Perhaps migration features around the edges, but those are two quite major issues. That means that we have not built anywhere near enough houses. This is not a new phenomenon, as it is a generational issue."}, {"speaker": "Mr Bacon:", "speech": "      Does my hon. Friend\u2014by the way, I was born in his constituency, in Browns Coppice Avenue\u2014think that it is instructive that we have heard a number of contributions from Conservative Members who were   "}, {"speaker": "Julian Knight:", "speech": "      I completely agree. It is ridiculous politics for people on the housing ladder to seek to pull it up and not allow others on. That is terribly two-faced, and entirely wrong."}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. He is the first person to make the wider point that I think we should focus on, which relates to issues such as the pensions system and the price of money. We often talk about supply, but the price of money is an issue too. After the crunch there was a complete collapse in economic activity, and Help to Buy was given a huge boost, with maximum prices of \u00a3600,000 and so on, which was necessary to rescue the economy from what would have become a depression."}, {"speaker": "Julian Knight:", "speech": "      My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. Help to Buy is very similar to the car scrappage scheme, which helped to rescue a major industry in 2008-09. The measure was introduced to allow house builders to get rid of dormant stock. As an economy, we are held captive by the lack of supply. Responsible Governments look at the supply side\u2014that is what we did in the 1980s\u2014for solutions, and that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get more homes built: the Government aspire to 200,000 a year, or 1 million in total. It is good to have stretching goals, but if we could just produce enough for the new families being formed, that would be satisfactory. In my constituency, we are stepping up to the plate. We have a local plan in place, unlike many areas represented by Opposition parties. We have met the challenge and are looking to build more homes, be it through direct build, right to buy or getting housing associations to build more homes\u2014they have not been building enough. I believe that devolution, through the combined authorities, can also help."}, {"speaker": "Rachael Maskell (York Central) (Lab/Co-op):", "speech": "      I want to bring this debate back to the reality I see in my surgeries week after week, as families come to me pleading for help."}, {"speaker": "Julian Knight:", "speech": "      Is the hon. Lady aware that in some parts of the country, such as Hull, the private rented sector is actually cheaper than the social rented sector? In some parts of the country, the private rented sector is sometimes a better option."}, {"speaker": "Rachael Maskell:", "speech": "      That is not the experience in my constituency, where people are being priced out of the city, which is having an impact on the local economy. Businesses are saying that it is really difficult to recruit and retain the vital staff they need because people cannot afford to live in our city. The NHS requires improvement, not on account of the excellent care provided by NHS staff, but because it is unable to recruit the staff it needs\u2014doctors, nurses and physiotherapists."}, {"speaker": "Mims Davies (Eastleigh) (Con):", "speech": "      I think that everyone has been delighted to contribute to the debate, and I am pleased to see that a quarter of the parliamentary Liberal Democrat party is present to appreciate it. [Hon. Members: \u201cOne less now!\u201d] I spoke too soon."}, {"speaker": "Steve Brine (Winchester) (Con):", "speech": "      I thank my long-term neighbour for giving way. I am glad that the leader of the Liberal Democrats has arrived to return his party\u2019s representation in the Chamber to a quarter. He said earlier that he needed to take people with him. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not \u201ctaking people with you\u201d to have a local plan and a borough consultation in my constituency that excludes Chandler\u2019s Ford? The people who live there have been locked out of the consultation."}, {"speaker": "Mims Davies:", "speech": "      I think my hon. Friend must have read my speech. I was about to say that people in Eastleigh felt locked out of the local planning process by a complacent council that is not listening to residents and taking them on the planning journey. No neighbourhood plans are being subjected to a referendum. Residents have not been encouraged to take part in the process; indeed, I would say that Eastleigh Borough Council has barred them from it. My inbox is full of correspondence from frustrated constituents who want to play their part in the provision of homes, but do not feel part of the process. The council is riding roughshod over where the homes should be built."}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge (South Suffolk) (Con):", "speech": "      I declare my interest as a director of a shared ownership property portal and a mortgage broker. I want to make a couple of points about second-hand supply, which is often overlooked, and about estate regeneration, for which the Prime Minister has set out a very bold agenda. All the statistics show that there is a record low in the number of instructions to estate agents in the second-hand market. That is actually one of the main crises that we are facing, because the second-hand market forms such a large part of the market."}, {"speaker": "Bob Stewart:", "speech": "      Given my hon. Friend\u2019s great expertise on this matter and my lack of knowledge, could he enlighten me as to what happens to the people who live on a sink estate when it is brought down and rebuilt? What happens to those people while they are having their homes rebuilt?"}, {"speaker": "James Cartlidge:", "speech": "      This is very simple. My hon. Friend is an expert on decanting, I think, and the answer to his question is that we decant them. That is the technical term. I am sure that this will be interesting to him, and I am sure that I know what he keeps in his decanter. It is probably the same nationality as his wife. The process is difficult however, because we do have to decant those people. One solution, which we saw at Woodberry Down, is to build the new housing and decant the people in stages. We saw another solution at the Elephant and Castle, which was difficult but there was no alternative. It was to allow the estate to run down and become empty over time. That is the toughest part of the process."}, {"speaker": "Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD):", "speech": "      First, I thank everyone who has contributed to this good-natured debate, leaving aside the unfortunate references to the size of the Liberal Democrat party. We can live with that for the next four and a half years, and we look forward to 2020 and seeing the Conservative Benches severely depleted."}, {"speaker": "The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (James Wharton):", "speech": "      What a fascinating debate this has been.

Gentleman on securing the debate. It is wonderful to see so much investment in our area. DONG Energy alone is spending some \u00a31 billion a year on offshore wind in the Humber region.

Friend and I have spoken about that on a regular basis, and we will continue to work together to ensure that we maximise the procurement of UK content wherever we can. The Humber region has huge potential to contribute to growth in the UK supply chain. Just last week we saw DONG Energy secure financial approval to build what will be by far and away the biggest offshore wind farm in the world, with around 1.2 GW\u2014enough to power 800,000 homes.
